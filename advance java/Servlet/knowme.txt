LifeCycle : 	
	Init
	Service
	Destroy
	
Filter : They are simple objects that can preporcess request before handing over to servlet and postprocess response before handing over to client.

response.sendRedirect() 
	new request is created hence slow.
	Request is transferred another resource to different domain or different server for futher processing.


requestDispatcher.forward()
	Request is transferred to same container
	No new request is created

PMD vs CheckStyle vs FindBugs

	CheckStyle is a basic veriosn for Static code analysis.
	It can non-organized imports, unused imports, white spaces, naming conventions, javadoc comments, code conventions

	PMD works on source code and therefore finds problems like: violation of naming conventions, lack of curly braces, misplaced null check, long parameter list, unnecessary constructor, missing break in switch, etc. PMD also tells you about the Cyclomatic complexity of your code which I find very helpful (FindBugs doesn't tell you about the Cyclomatic complexity).
	Works on uncompiled code.
	Finds dead code,  possible bugs, duplicate code
	its advance version of checkstyle.
	
	FindBugs works on bytecode. Here are some problems FindBugs finds which PMD doesn't: equals() method fails on subtypes, clone method may return null, reference comparison of Boolean values, impossible cast, 32bit int shifted by an amount not in the range of 0-31, a collection which contains itself, equals method always returns true, an infinite loop, etc.
	Works on bytecode.
