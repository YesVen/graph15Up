Representational State Transfer
Merely an Architechtural Style
Services built on the principles of REST are called RESTful web services
Uses HTTP protocol

Advantages : 
	Lightweight
	Stateless
		Doesnt maintain what client has asked before current request?
		i.e client cannot say, give me account balance of user in last response. server simply dont remember last response.
	No specification and tight coupling (like WSDL though it has WADL somewhere)
	Caching mechanism
	No language/framework barrier cause it can work with any lang and fw.
	Can work with any data type(due to HTTP)
	Layered Architecture
		We can Put an extra middleware layer between client and server which can have diffrent purpose(redirecting, partial response etc). This is called layered architecture
	
REST style has a specification JAX-RS
SOAP style has a specification JAX-WS

JAX-RS Specification is implementated by few vendors like 
		Apache CXF
		JBoss RestEasy
		Oracle Jersey
		GlassFish Jersey
		
JAX-WS Specification is implementated by few vendors like 
		Apache Axis
		
		

JAX-RS Specification defines some annotations like below
@GET @PUT @POST @DELETE
@Path : Class and method level annotation.
@FormParam @MatrixParam @HeaderParam @PathParam
@Produces @Consumes

@Path : Class and method level annotation.
@Produces : Method and class level annotation
@Consumes : Class and method level annotation

JAX-B : Comes with J2EE platform in build
		Used for XML marshelling
		
		
		
Jackson : Need to add maven dependency.	Used for JSON marshelling
				<dependency>
					<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs</groupId>
					<artifactId>jackson-jaxrs-json-provider</artifactId>
					<version>2.8.0</version>
				</dependency>


REST Exception Hierarchy:
	WebApplicationException
		ClientErrorException	status 4xx   	e.g. BadRequestException,NotFoundException etc
		RedirectionException	status 3xx		e.g. 
		ServerErrorException	status 5xx 		e.g. InternalServerErrorException, ServiceUnavailableException
All these exception are analogous with custom Exception mapper.		

		
IF method produces more than one type, then what type to return is decided based on Accept header of request.

Rest Client

Rest Filters
	ContainerRequestFilter
	ContainerResponseFilter
	ClientRequestFilter
	ClientResponseFilter
	
Rest Authentication Using ContainerResponseFilter

Rest Interceptor

Interceptor vs Filter
	Filter : Designed to manipualate metadata i.e. headers, URI etc
	Interceptor : Designed to manipulate the input and output streams i.e. body

Difference between MessagebodyWriter and Interceptors??????????????	
	Interceptor mainly designed to convert data in body to some other format(base64 to utf format) while messagebodyreader/writer are used to actually write the data(Converting data to java object) on the input/output streams.
	
Programs : 
	Produces multiple types : Use Accept Header
	Add AuthenticationFilter to ApparelService
	Find out which authentication do enovia servers use? observe request going through
