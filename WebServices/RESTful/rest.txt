Representational State Transfer
Merely an Architechtural Style
Services built on the principles of REST are called RESTful web services
Uses HTTP protocol

Advantages : 
	Lightweight
	Stateless
		Doesnt maintain what client has asked before current request?
		i.e client cannot say, give me account balance of user in last response. server simply dont remember last response.
	No specification and tight coupling (like WSDL though it has WADL somewhere)
	Caching mechanism
	No language/framework barrier cause it can work with any lang and fw.
	Can work with any data type(due to HTTP)
	Layered Architecture
		We can Put an extra middleware layer between client and server which can have diffrent purpose(redirecting, partial response etc). This is called layered architecture
	
REST style has a specification JAX-RS
SOAP style has a specification JAX-WS

JAX-RS Specification is implementated by few vendors like 
		Apache CXF
		JBoss RestEasy
		Oracle Jersey
		GlassFish Jersey
		
JAX-WS Specification is implementated by few vendors like 
		Apache Axis
		
		

JAX-RS Specification defines some annotations like below
@GET @PUT @POST @DELETE
@Path : Class and method level annotation.
@FormParam @MatrixParam @HeaderParam @PathParam
@Produces @Consumes

@Path : Class and method level annotation.
@Produces : Method and class level annotation
@Consumes : Class and method level annotation


Write programs for : 
@Context
@BeanParam
@UriInfo
