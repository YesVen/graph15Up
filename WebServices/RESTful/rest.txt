Representational State Transfer
Merely an Architechtural Style
Services built on the principles of REST are called RESTful web services
Uses HTTP protocol

Advantages : 
	Lightweight
	Stateless
		Doesnt maintain what client has asked before current request?
		i.e client cannot say, give me account balance of user in last response. server simply dont remember last response.
	No specification and tight coupling (like WSDL though it has WADL somewhere)
	Caching mechanism
	No language/framework barrier cause it can work with any lang and fw.
	Can work with any data type(due to HTTP)
	Layered Architecture
		We can Put an extra middleware layer between client and server which can have diffrent purpose(redirecting, partial response etc). This is called layered architecture
	
REST style has a specification JAX-RS(1.0,2.0)
SOAP style has a specification JAX-WS

JAX-RS Specification provided by SUn and is implementated by few vendors like 
		Jersey from Oracle, 
		Resteasy from Jboss, 
		CXF from Apache
		Jersey from GlassFish and blah blah blah
		
JAX-WS Specification is implementated by few vendors like 
		Apache Axis
		
Note : Apache CXF provides implementation for SOAP and RESTful services both		
		
Annotations : 
	JAX-RS Specification defines some annotations like below
	@GET @PUT @POST @DELETE
	@Path : Class and method level annotation.
	@FormParam @MatrixParam @HeaderParam @PathParam @CookieParam
	@Produces @Consumes

	@Path : Class and method level annotation. url field marked under @path is case sensitive
	@Produces : Method or field level annotation
	@Consumes : Class and method level annotation


	@MatrixParam : The important difference is that matrix parameters apply to a particular path element while query parameters apply to the request as a whole. This comes into play when making a complex REST-style query to multiple levels of resources and sub-resources
		e.g http://example.com/res/categories;name=foo/objects;name=green/?page=1
		In above example,categories;name=foo --->  name matrixparam is local to category only
						 objects;name=greeen --->  name matrixparam is local to objects only
					 

Jersey Annotations : 
	Jersey has added few more annotations for making developers life easy
	1.	@Provider : 
	Find out rest of the annotations
