Maven : 
	Project Management tool + Build Tool
	
Need of Maven : 
	Multiple jars in project
	Hard to maintain the dependencies and their versions
	Project structure 
	Build, publish and Deploy
	


Terms :
	groupId : Package Structure
	artifactId  : Name of the Application.


Commands : 
	mvn archetype:generate  -> Download all required plugins maven needs to function efficiently.
	mvn compile -> 
	mvn package -> 
	

Maven Lifecycle Default phases :
Validate : Check pom.xml is present or not. Check for dependencies required for running maven.
Compile : Project compilation. target folder generation.
Test : run test cases under test folder
Package : package code in jar/war/ear.	
Install : Its not deploying on server. Its about storing package under local .m2 repo so that other projects has this dependency on his package, 
			 it can be used easily
Deploy : its not deploying to server in this phase. Once a package is created you mat want to publish it to remote site where other users want to use the 
            latest package that you created.


You can target any of the above phases like mvn compile, mvn package etc.
It will automatiacally run all its previous phases
mvn package will automatically run validate, test, compile and package.			
			
			
mvn clean : Cleans up artifacts that are created by prior builds.
			It clean maven directory by deleting all generated content like target folder, jars etc.

Dependency : 
	It has 4 co-ordinates. GroupId, ArtifactId, vrsion and scope.
	Out of these G A V and mandatory where as scope is optional (default is compile scope...meaning this dependency is available at compile time only)
	
	
	
Scopes of dependency:
		test : Dependency is needed at test compile and execution time.
		compile : Default scope.  Dependency is needed at compile time.
		provided : Indicates dependency is provided by underlying env like jdk, container or web server.
		Runtime : Dependency is needed at run time.
		System : Indicates this dependency has to be provided system path
		Import
		
Maven architecture is based on plugins. A lot of plugins come together to deliver solid end user experience. Maven allows us to play with those plugins and modify their default behaviour.
e.g. By default maven uses maven-comoiler-plugin when we run mvn compile command.
	 We can alter the version of the plugin maven should use.
	 Using build tag
		<build>
			<plugins>
				<plugin>
					<groupid>org.maven.plugins</groupid>
					<artifactid>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactid>
					<configuration>
						<source>1.4</source>
						<target>1.4</target>
					</configuration>	
				</plugin>
				<plugin>
					write all customizations you want to have for this plugin
				</plugin>
				<plugin>
					write all customizations you want to have for this plugin
				</plugin>
			</plugins>
		</build>
	 
	 
mvn clean  compile : You can issue a command like this as well.
					 it will combine clean and compile both one after the other.

Jetty Plugin : Its a lightweight container that can be configured using maven. It comes as a plugin which we can configure in maven. 
				Then we can use "mvn jetty:run"  command to deploy our application on jetty container.
				no need to install/configure tomcat.
				
You can convert any arbitrary folder into a eclipse project by using eclipse plugin of maven.
(Eclipse has a mven plugin and maven has a eclipse plugin)
just to to your maven project and run mvn eclipse:eclipse.
Maven will automatically add .project, .classpath etc files to folder.
Update : Seems maven no longer has maven-eclipse-plugin plugin.
			
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
Dynamic Properties :
	You can define properties in <properties> tag.
	They can be defined later in any tag.
	
	<properties>									
		<java.version>1.8</java.version>
		<junit.version>4.11</junit.version>
	</properties>

	It can be used later as,
	<dependency>
		<groupId>junit</groupId>
		<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
		<version>${junit.version}</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings.xml : 
		maven has certain settings files by using which it does its processing. We can update those files to alter default behavior of maven.
		
		
		Global Settings : These settings are applicable to all users of maven on a machine. 
						  It resides at maven path D:\mvn\apache-maven-3.5.2-bin\apache-maven-3.5.2\conf\settings.xml
						  
		User Settings : This setting file is located at user directory at C:\Users\dbe1\.m2\settings.xml.
						This setting is applicable to only dbe1 user.
				
		both files are optional.
		They hold critical information that maven needs like,
			profiles : sit-test, uat-test, prod etc.
			mirrors : This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
			proxies: 
			interactive-mode : true/false
			offline : true/false
			localrepository : path to local m2repo

How to exclude dependency?
			
what is snapshot Dependencies ?
	Snapshot dependencies are dependencies (JAR files) which are under development. Instead of constantly updating the version numbers to get the latest version, you can depend on a snapshot version of the project. Snapshot versions are always downloaded into your local repository for every build, even if a matching snapshot version is already located in your local repository. Always downloading the snapshot dependencies assures that you always have the latest version in your local repository, for every build.
	
	You can tell Maven that your project is a snapshot version simply by appending -SNAPSHOT to the version number.
	<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
