splice method of array

parent vs parents vs parentsUntil vs parent

closest vs parents
    closest : starts with the current element and exits when it finds matched selector. 
                It will return the first matched element
    parents : starts with the current element and exits when it finds matched selector
                It will return the set of elements from itself till parent.(Including parent)
    parentUntill : starts with the current element and exits when it finds matched selector
                It will return the set of elements from itself till parent excluding parent 
                    see..its parents untill...self explainatory

contents vs children : both finds children except, contents will include text and comment nodes also

has vs hasClass vs is
    ul.has(li) ---> true/false
    hasClass --> Simple
    li.is(:first-child)---> true

filter vs find vs grep
    grep : works on array. $ object has grep function
    find : works on jquery object
    
map vs each
    both used to iterate over the set of elements
    map : creates a new set of elements by mapping original elements.
            lowercaseLetters.map ---> uppercase letters
            Here a new set of elements are created as uppercase letters keeping original set intact
    each : original set get modified        


after vs insertAfter
    Both are inverses of each other
    a after b ---> ab :::: tell browser that a's after element is b
    a insertAfter b ---> ba


remove vs Detach
   remove removes an element from DOM. Same element cannot be add after removing.
   detach removes element from DOM but returns it to you in form of jquery object so thatyou can work on it


replaceAll vs ReplaceWith
    As like after and insertAfter they are inverses of each opher.

html() vs text()
    text : it will return only text of all elements "recursively"
    html : return html contents of target


wrap vs unwrap vs wrapAll vs wrapInner
    $('.green').wrap(<div></div>) : wraps each  green element with div.
    $('.green').wrapAll(<div></div>) : wraps all element with div. Note here only one div will be added over for all green elements.
    
   wrapInner :  Wrap an HTML structure around the "content of each element" in the set of matched elements.  
    

children vs find
   children() only looks at the immediate children of the node, while find() traverses the entire DOM below the node
   
   
   
   
   
extend vs fn.extend
    extend : USed to merge two or more objects into first object
    fn.extend : to write jquery plugins
    
    
toArray vs makeArray
    toArray : convert jquery set to js array
    makeArray : converts any arraylike object to pure js array
                make array is static method..... $.makearray(document.getElementsByTagName("div"));
                    here, document.getElementsByTagName("div") returns a nodelist which is not a jquery set nor an array
					
					
					
Event Lifecycle : Trickle down, bubble up
				  Capturing, targeting and  Bubbling		
				  
				  
Target vs currentTarget
				target : Where event has actually happended
				currentTarget : the listner element during event propogation phases capturing and bubbling
				
				
StopPropogation 
	In event bubbling phase if we call this method, then it will terminate the bubling phase.
	The parent listeners will not able to listen to the event.

stopImmediatePropogation
	an element can attach more then one listener for a single event.
	If we call event.stopImmediatePropogation() then,
		parent listeners will not able to listen to the event + rest event handlers of of this element will not be listened.
		
		p attaches two events on click. One is using stopImmediatePropagation so second event will not be listened
		
		$("p").click(function(event){
		  event.stopImmediatePropagation();
		});
		$("p").click(function(event){
		  // This function won't be executed
		  $(this).css("background-color", "#f00");
		});
