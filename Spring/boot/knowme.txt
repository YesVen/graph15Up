Spring Boot : Create stand alone and production ready app that "just run".

It takes lot of burden away from you like,
	complex bean configuration
	servlet container configuration
	etc.
	
It follows design style "convention over configuration" as that of maven.

Just create your main method similar to standard java program and run it. It internally spawns a servlet container and run app on it. That too within few seconds.
