Use Spring tools suite IDE/eclipse plugin for spring developement *******************

As an alternative when everyone is struggling with heavy weight EJBs

Advantages:
		code in POJOS
		Dependancy injection (IoC)
		Lightweight
		
IoC is a general concept and it can be implemented in multiple ways. DI is just a flavour of IoC.
IoC says , "The application controls the framework, not the framework controls the application".
Even if you remove spring itself from the equation, your application still is decoupled. That much power spring puts in your app.
