Why MVC
	Problem :
		JSP is terrible since it embeds your core business code into views
		Servlets are great in terms of seperation of business and view but messes terribly fails in presentation.
		Thus was born the Model 2 architecture MVC.
	Modal 1
	Modal 2
	Modal 3
	Modal 4
	
	

DispatcherServlet = Front Controller
		It is servlet container class that written by Spring designers to handle web request. The primary entry point for a Spring application is the DispatcherServlet. It acts as front controller class which does common things like copying data to bean, basic validation etc. It then forwards requst to individual controllers written by developer.
		Its written based on JSP modal 2.
		Its Front Controller Servlets
		
		
Is it mandatory to add .htm ass pattern for spring?
No but 99% people use it

HandlerMappingClasses 
	Its job is to identify the correcdt handlers for the incoming request.
	There are plenty of handlers available in spring.
	BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping :
			This class maps url based to bean which can handle this request
	

In annotation based configuration, we dont require handler mapping as we can directly annotate a method wrt request its serving.
