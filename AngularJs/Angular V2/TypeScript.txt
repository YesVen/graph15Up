Superset of JS

Js with some good additions like classes, types and more.

It gets compiled internally to js.So we essentially writing typescript code to be compiled to js and then run on browser.

Polyfill??

In js, 
	a =10;
	a = "Dnyanesh";//This is allowed
In Typescript,
	a =10;
	a = "Ashu" ====> NOT ALLOWED
	but a = 20 is allowed
You cannot change type of a variable in typescript	

Variable declaration : 
	We can declare type of variable
		name:String = "Dnyanesh";
		score:number : 80;
		
		dd:any     ------ dd can be of any type. Once we assign value of some type to dd, it cannot be changed further
		myVar:number[] ----- myVar is a number array
		aa:string[] --------- aa is a string array
		
		car:Car = new Car();
	Note: This syntax is similar to Actionscript
