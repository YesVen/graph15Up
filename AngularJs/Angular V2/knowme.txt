Based on Typescript (Superset of javascript) 
	There are some functionalities which typescript offers and js dont, thats why designer decided to go with typescript.
	Typescript is developed and maintained by Microsoft

Makes use of ECMA6/ECMA2015 to write code - classes,importing modules

Controllers are no more. Only components. It doesn't enforces MVC or MVW.

You write  code in typescript and it gets automatically compiles to javascript. (.ts -> .js + .map.js)

nodejs, npm and angular CLI are  prerequisites.	
	Install Node
	Install NPM
	Install angular CLI : Command Line Interface for angular 2 applications
						  It has commands that allows you to create project skeleton, add components, define build configuration, test and deploy.	 
							
						  Install angular CLi by running:  npm install -g @angular/cli	
						  Create your  project by running :  ng new my-first-app
						  Got to your project directory and run:  ng  serve --open
						To create  a Component : ng generate component heroes
							This will create a new component in your app. It will add heroes folder in your app.
							This folder contains all elements required  for a component like .css, .html  and .ts file.
							It will also link your new component with AppModule(see appmodule.ts file)
							
						To create a Service : ng generate service hero						

Typescript is compiled to javascript internally.
component.ts file is compiles to component.js and component.spec.ts(internal representation file)
