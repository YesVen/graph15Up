frustration with monolithic applications

Create your application as a suite of services instead of one tightly coupled monolith of code, and it's easier to change and maintain

e.g. If BPS has some jars and all other apps are using those jars to do their stuff. Now tomorow BPS found one bug which is very critical.
How would other apps incorporate the fix?
      take corrected jar, replace it in package, restart server.
      This would create a havoc as all the apps depending on the BPS jar need to redeployed. Consumers of those apps would not like it.
      Born is the Microservices architecture.
