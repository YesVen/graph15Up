Mock : 	They are just objects without any proerties beinf set on them.
	
		@Mock Student student
		This will create a student mock object with no properties in student.

Stub : 	This refers to stubbing actual method calls of Student class.
		Now we have createda mock, we can call Student class methods,
			student.goToSchool();


Spy : 	Sometimes rather than using mock objects we require actual objects that have all the properties set on them.
		e.g. Mickito.spy()
		Their usage is discouraged though and should be used at rarest siatuaion.
