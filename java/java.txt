 Crux :
 	same name to two threads?
 	A hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor. The scheduler is free to ignore this hint.
 	if a thread takes too much time for execution, it can use yield method to check if there are any
 	runnable thread of same priority is present. If yes give its resources for execution.
 	
 	When a thread yields, it comes to waiting state. There is no gurantee when it will get chance for execution
