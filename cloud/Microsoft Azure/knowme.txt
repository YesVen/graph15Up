Function : 
		Serveless Architechture
		
Service Fabric :


Container Service : 


Event Hub :
		This guy is used in scenarios where there are millions of senders and billions of listeners to it. IT is fast, scalable and robust just like kafka.
		Get started sending events and Get started receiving events using the Event Processor Host   https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples
	

Kafka : 
		Its a highly scalable robust and impressively fast queing service where we can send data and interested listeners can listen to it.
		We can send data using toping and only those listeners which are listening on that topic will get that published data.

		Its a publisher-subscriber mechanism of the cloud.
		Data can be sent-received in two formats.
				Queue : Ony one sender and one receiver.
				Topic : One sender and many receivers of the same sent data.
				Relay : ?

App Service Env : 
		A fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App services.
		
		
CosmosDB :

Azure Stack :	
		Its a cloud environment for on premises enviroment.
		Microsoft is trying to cover on premises clients who cannot go on public cloud environment due to security and proprietery signoff isssues.
